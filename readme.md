# MetaGan.
This project was developed based on the idea that for the GAN loss function, only a single value is neededâ€”indicating either high or super resolution (HR or SR). Therefore, an attempt was made to implement the loss function using binary classification. As a result, this approach proved to be viable, increasing network stability and enabling the use of more advanced techniques to enhance discriminator performance, with only a minimal increase in memory and computational costs.
